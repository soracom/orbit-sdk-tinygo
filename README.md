# orbit-sdk-tinygo [![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/soracom/orbit-sdk-tinygo)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/soracom/orbit-sdk-tinygo) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/soracom/orbit-sdk-tinygo)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/soracom/orbit-sdk-tinygo)

A SORACOM Orbit SDK is for [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/) to generate wasm modules.

## Synopsis

### Hello world

```go
import sdk github.com/soracom/orbit-sdk-tinygo

// For processing uplink (UE to SORACOM)
//export uplink
func uplink() sdk.ErrorCode {
	sdk.Log("hello world, uplink")
	return 0
}

// For processing downlink (SORACOM to UE)
//export downlink
func downlink() sdk.ErrorCode {
	sdk.Log("hello world, downlink")
	return 0
}
```

And more pragmatic examples are in [examples/](./examples/).

## Description

Please see [godoc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/soracom/orbit-sdk-tinygo) for detailed instructions on how to use this SDK.

## Known issues

### Running wasm on the SORACOM Orbit "sandbox" runtime

There are some heavily restricted rules to execute your wasm module on the SORACOM Orbit runtime. For example:

- It doesn't allow to execute a wasm module that depends on `syscall/js.*`
  - Basically, wasm that is generated by TinyGo depends on `js` runtime (see also: https://tinygo.org/webassembly/webassembly/).
  - However, the Orbit runtime doesn't support the `js` runtime. So __it is necessary to avoid such dependencies carefully__.
    - For example, `fmt` package is not allowed because the package requires `syscall/js.*` modules.
- `json` package is not supported by TinyGo.
  - see also: https://tinygo.org/lang-support/stdlib/
  - This SDK uses the following libraries for workaround.
    - [moznion/go-json-ice](https://github.com/moznion/go-json-ice)
    - [moznion/jsonparser#without_js_runtime_tinygo](https://github.com/moznion/jsonparser/tree/without_js_runtime_tinygo)
